## Introduction

Assignment one is a three page, responsive layout. The student will create the site using best practice techniques for web and a typical framework with a reset of their choice.

Each page will have three different layouts.
1.	Smallest Screen Size starting at 320px
2.	Medium Screen Size starting at 875px
3.	Large Screen Size starting at 1400px

Font sizing will be coded with relative units and render to the following px values on the screen:
•	Paragraphs = 18px
•	Heading h1 = 44px
•	Heading h2 = 35px
•	Heading h3 = 28px
•	Heading h4 = 22px
Each page will have fluid, edge-to-edge content for both the small and medium screen sizes. These screen sizes will have spacing of 16px on the left and right sides. Starting at 1300px the content will then become contained in a fixed-width, centered container. There will be no left and right spacing within the fixed-width container. Background images and background colors will fill 100% screen width.
